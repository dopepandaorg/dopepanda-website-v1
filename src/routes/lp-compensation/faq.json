Some LP holders that have removed their LP after DopePanda reduced the Official LP by 75%, may have been affected by impermanent loss, giving them more DPANDA compared to ALGO.<br/><br/>Our compensation program will EXCHANGE the amount of lost ALGO in return for the excess DPANDA. <br/><br/>We have pre-calculated the difference and set up compensation at the price we reduced the official LP (0.00013 ALGO)."

By reducing our Official LP, the amount of Liquidity dropped substantially and caused an unfavorable trade for LP Holders who removed their LP during a high price fluctuation."
