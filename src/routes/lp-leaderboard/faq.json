			"title": "What is my Live Stake?",
			"content": "Your live stake is the amount of DPANDA tokens held by you in the Tinyman DPANDA <-> ALGO LP Pool. This is different to the 'Snapshot' which is a record of your committed LP taken at 4pm UTC on Sunday on the respective week."

			"title": "How are rewards calculated?",
			"content": "Each week DopePanda distributes 2,000,000 DPANDA tokens to its eligible LP Holders. The reward for each eligible LP holder is calculated by their share of LP at each Weekly Snapshot. <br/><br/> eg. If “Address ABC” holds 5% of the Tinyman DPANDA <-> ALGO LP Pool (minus DopePanda's Official LP), they are eligible to receive 5% of 2,000,000 DPANDA tokens every week."
